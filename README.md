Task 2 in the course "Datalagring" or "Data Storage Paradigms". For this task we transitioned from the Conceptual Model created in Task 1 and transformed it into a Logical and Physical Model. After that, we created the database and generated data for all tables in the model which will be used to query the database in the forthcoming task 3.
